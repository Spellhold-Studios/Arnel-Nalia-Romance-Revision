INTRODUCTION
++++++++++++

This is a WeiDU-based version of the original mod. This mod is now in a WeiDU format and can be installed with other mods for BG2.

Contact me at the Spellhold Studios forum if you have issues/problems.

The original mod can still be found at http://web.starman.ee/arnel/nalia/.

This mod adds a complete romance with Nalia, including the tree of life dialogs, beloved one in danger, Nalia's abduction by Bodhi, and other love related quests. It also adds some new quests and character interactions.

Having Minsc in the party is recommended...

By the way, there is another Nalia romance mod in the works. It is called de'Arnise Romance and is hosted by the PocketPlaneGroup. I don't know if it has been released yet or not.


HISTORY
+++++++

I simply decided that I wanted another mod to add to my game, so I converted this mod from its original format (which made it incompatible with everything else). You can install it at any time after patching your SoA/ToB game.


Don't install Arnel's Nalia Romance alongside with de'Arnise Romance because installing two dedicated PC/Nalia romances would be a poor idea.

INSTALLATION
++++++++++++

It is in WeiDU format. To install, unzip the zip file to your game folder and double-click on setup-luvnalia.exe. To un-install, double-click on setup-lunaalia.exe again and select the un-install option.

The install has two parts. You have to install both to make this mod work. You can un-install the first part later for patch updates. The second part only needs to be un-installed if totally removing the mod.


WALKTHROUGH
+++++++++++

Having never actually played this mod before, I do not have a walkthrough for this mod.  I don't know if one exists for the original mod. If so, it would work on this version.


CREDITS
+++++++

Arnel, where ever you are, for creating this mod.

Spellhold Studios for allowing me to host this mod.

TheWizard for also hosting this mod.


F.A.Q.
++++++

1. This mod requires ToB to be installed. I know the original one doesn't but I didn't include the files that make it work. If you try that yourself, you should be able to make this work.

2. This mod was repackaged to work with the original 4 romances. I did not test it with any other romance mod. I am not sure what the results would be.

3. I know there is supposed to be a problem with the Sharp Teeth Pass area (AR1700). I haven't tested it yet, so I don't know what problems you will encounter. Tactics has issues with this area, you may not want to install that part of Tactics with this mod.

+++++++
